<h1>Amazon Scrape Project:</h1><br/>
This is a web scraping project aimed at gathering data from Amazon regarding washing machines and saving it in TXT and CSV files.
I used two different methods: the first one using the selenium library in headless mode, and the second one using the requests library.
